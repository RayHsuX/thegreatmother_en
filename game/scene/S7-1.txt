Genealogy tree: “I am the genealogy tree of this world, and when every time a new life is born, I grow a new branch. -族谱树2.mp3;
Likewise, as each life passes away, that branch withers. -族谱树3.mp3;
When I was a seed or a sapling, I was rooted in the tower. -族谱树4.mp3;
I don't know exactly which floor level I was on, but I worked hard to root and grow for so long that I couldn't even reach the top of the tower in the forgetfulness of time. -族谱树5.mp3;
I wonder if humans or gods seeded me? -族谱树6.mp3;
During the long development of mankind, people gradually blurred the origin of life, and began to have the distinction of countries, nations, groups… -族谱树7.mp3;
This floor records the genealogy of this world. -族谱树8.mp3;
If you want to know where you came from? Where are you going? -族谱树9.mp3;
Just keep forward, don't look back, don't linger. -族谱树10.mp3;
Go to the floor which is flush with the earth, and they will guide you." -族谱树11.mp3;

:So you begin to ascend again, and the spiral passage gives the illusion that it is downward, as if you are back in the well. 
After a long non-stop upward journey, you finally reach the ground level of the tower, which has a huge open door to the outside world.
Outside is a world of light. You are drawn through, but there is a transparent barrier in front of the door to block your steps out.;
